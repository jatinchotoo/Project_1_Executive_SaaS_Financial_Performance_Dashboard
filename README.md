![Executive Dashboard Preview](screenshots/Executive_summary.png)

## Executive Summary
A CFO‑oriented Power BI intelligence platform designed to transform fragmented SaaS billing and general ledger data into **decision‑ready financial signals**.

The dashboard automates unit economics, capital efficiency ratios, and cross‑entity benchmarking to support **executive capital allocation, performance management, and risk governance**.

---

## 💡 Why This Project Is Different
Most dashboards explain *what happened*.

This platform is engineered to signal **what executives should do next** by embedding:
- Financial theory (ROE, leverage efficiency, capital productivity)
- Explicit performance thresholds
- Automated risk‑signaling logic

Directly into the analytics layer — reflecting how analytics are actually used in **CFO, FP&A, and Strategy environments**.

---

## 🎯 Business Intelligence Objectives
This platform enables senior leadership to:
- Monitor **MRR / ARR growth quality**, not just topline volume
- Evaluate **capital structure efficiency** (ROE, Debt‑to‑Equity, Liquidity)
- Identify underperforming entities using **traffic‑light risk logic**
- Benchmark subsidiaries against **internal hurdle rates** (15% ROE)

---

## 🛠️ Data Architecture & Governance
- **Data Modeling:** Star schema optimized for DAX performance and scalability  
- **ETL:** Power Query (M) to normalize heterogeneous ledger and billing files  
- **DAX Engineering:** Custom time‑intelligence measures for CAGR, YoY growth, and risk flags  

This architecture mirrors real‑world finance transformation initiatives.
